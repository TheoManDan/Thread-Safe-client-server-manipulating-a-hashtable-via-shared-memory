Implement two programs in C/C++/Rust:

* Server program:

     - Initialize a hash table of given size (command line)  - (done)

     - Support insertion of items in the hash table  - (done) 

     - Hash table collisions are resolved by maintaining a linked list
for each bucket/entry in the hash table                - (done)

     - Supports concurrent operations (multithreading) to eprform
(insert, read, delete operations on the hash table)    - (done)

     - Use readers-writer lock to ensure safety of concurrent
operations, try to optimize the granularity - (done)

     - Communicates with the client program using shared memory buffer
(POSIX shm)                                  - (done)

* Client program:

     - Enqueue requests/operations (insert, read a bucket, delete) to
the server (that will operate on the the hash table) via shared memory
buffer (POSIX shm)                                                         - (done)


Please send me the code with a Makefile to compile and run the code via
Github.

Please also include a scalability analysis.
